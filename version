1.5.0;
- Ported to Kade Engine! Still not perfect as cutscenes are not yet added.
	- Allows ghost tapping, which means you can press without missing (CAN BE CHANGED IN OPTIONS MENU)
	- Options Menu (WITH CUSTOM MODIFIERS LIKE REANIMATED SPRITES AND ZAVODILA EFFECTS!!)
	- Allows custom keybinds.
	- Scores WILL be reset since it now uses ~\AppData\Roaming for save data.
	- Kade Engine settings WILL be reset since the app uses a custom filename.
- BRAND NEW CHARTS!
	- All difficulties are currently the same since I haven't gotten around to charting the rest lol
	- yeah you can't get the old ones lol
	- Fixed Zavodila having an incorrect BPM
